# VideoSumm - Video Summarization

VideoSumm is an automated video summarization project that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to generate concise and informative summaries from long videos. This project aims to help users efficiently navigate and comprehend video content by providing a condensed version that captures the essential information and key moments. Implements techniques such as K-means clustering and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to extract meaningful information and generate accurate summaries.

# Dataset

# SumMe 
SumMe dataset was chosen for training and evaluating the summarization models. The SumMe dataset is a collection of 25 videos that have been manually annotated with keyframe-level importance scores by multiple human annotators. The videos were selected to cover a diverse range of content, such as documentaries, sports, and home videos.
The link to download the dataset is provided in the Reference document.

The length of the summarized videos is 15% of the original video length. The models are tested against random videos. The detailed description is given in Video_Summarization.pdf file.
